        "\n",
        "    Both represent text data as vectors in a numerical space. This allows machine learning models to analyze and understand the relationships between words and sentences.\n",
        "    Both can be used for various tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and information retrieval.\n",

        "*   Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Scope: Word embeddings typically focus on representing individual words, while OpenAI embeddings can handle entire sentences or even paragraphs. This makes OpenAI embeddings more versatile for tasks that require understanding the context of a piece of text.\n",
        "    Training data: Word embeddings are often trained on large datasets of text and code, like books and articles. OpenAI embeddings are trained on a wider variety of data, including code, web documents, and social media posts. This can make them more robust to different types of text.\n",
        "    Complexity: Word embeddings are simpler and have lower dimensionality (fewer vector elements), while OpenAI embeddings are more complex and have higher dimensionality. This can make OpenAI embeddings more accurate but also computationally more expensive.\n",

        "\n",
        "    Imagine BERT as a chef preparing a special dish called \"text meaning.\"\n",
        "    The first step involves chopping the text into smaller pieces (words or subwords).\n",

        "    This is like a chef concentrating on the key flavors while cooking.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Layer by Layer Flavoring:\n",
        "\n",
        "    BERT has multiple layers, each adding more depth and complexity to the understanding.\n",
        "    Each layer considers the context of surrounding words and adjusts the meaning accordingly.\n",
        "    It's like a chef building flavors gradually, tasting and adjusting as they go.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Hidden Word Descriptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Within each layer, BERT creates hidden representations of each word, like secret recipes.\n",
        "    These representations capture the meaning of each word in relation to its neighbors and the overall context.\n",

        "5. Final Embedding Dish:\n",
        "\n",
        "    After multiple layers, BERT produces a final embedding for the whole text.\n",
        "    This embedding is like the finished dish, representing the condensed meaning and relationships within the text.\n",
